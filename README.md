# E-commerce Analytics Dashboard – Power BI Capstone Project
## 📌 Project Overview
This project involves building an interactive Power BI dashboard to analyze key metrics of an e-commerce business, including sales performance, order delays, customer behavior, and payment trends. The goal is to extract actionable insights, improve decision-making, and optimize business operations using data visualization and analysis.

## 🔍 Problem Statement
E-commerce businesses generate vast amounts of data daily, including orders, customer transactions, and product interactions. However, without proper analysis and visualization, this data remains underutilized. The major challenges include:

1. Understanding sales trends and identifying top-performing products.
2. Identifying reasons for order delays and their impact on customer satisfaction.
3. Analyzing customer behavior, payment preferences, and regional sales performance.
4. Extracting data-driven insights for better strategic planning.

## 🛠 Approach to Solve the Problem
To address these challenges, I followed a structured approach:

1. Data Collection & Cleaning – Used Power Query to clean and preprocess the dataset, handling missing values and standardizing data types.
2. Data Modeling & Relationships – Established connections between Orders, Products, Customers, and Payment datasets for efficient querying.
3. DAX Calculations & KPIs – Created measures for Total Sales, Delayed Orders, On-Time Orders, Review Scores, and Revenue Trends.
4. Dashboard Design & Interactivity – Developed a multi-page dashboard with interactive navigation buttons and tooltips for better insights.
5. Visualization & Insights Extraction – Implemented bar charts, line graphs, pie charts, and tree maps to present meaningful trends and business performance.

## 🚀 Implementation & Achievements
1️⃣ Data Cleaning & Transformation
1. Resolved missing values (e.g., order_delivered_carrier_date).
2. Converted incorrect data types and standardized values.
3. Merged multiple datasets for a structured and optimized data model.
2️⃣ Data Modeling & DAX Calculations
1. Established one-to-many relationships between key datasets (Orders, Customers, Products, Sellers).
2. Created DAX measures to compute Total Revenue, Average Review Score, Delayed Orders, and Seasonal Sales Trends.
3️⃣ Dashboard Development & Design
1. Multi-Page Navigation: Implemented shapes as buttons for navigating across Sales Analysis, Delayed Orders, Customer Insights, and Payment Analysis.
2. Tooltips for Contextual Insights: Enabled hover-over explanations for better user understanding.
3. Slicers & Filters: Added interactive filters for Year, Quarter, and State to allow dynamic data exploration.
4️⃣ Key Insights & Business Impact
1. Identified best-selling product categories to optimize marketing strategies.
2. Detected delivery inefficiencies by analyzing delayed order trends across different regions.
3. Provided insights on customer payment preferences, helping businesses streamline checkout processes.
4. Visualized regional sales performance, enabling targeted business expansion strategies.
